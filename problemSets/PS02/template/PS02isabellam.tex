		\vspace{.25cm}
	The following table was created using the data from a study run in a major Latin American city.\footnote{Fried, Lagunes, and Venkataramani (2010). ``Corruption and Inequality at the Crossroad: A Multimethod Study of Bribery and Discrimination in Latin America. \textit{Latin American Research Review}. 45 (1): 76-97.} As part of the experimental treatment in the study, one employee of the research team was chosen to make illegal left turns across traffic to draw the attention of the police officers on shift. Two employee drivers were upper class, two were lower class drivers, and the identity of the driver was randomly assigned per encounter. The researchers were interested in whether officers were more or less likely to solicit a bribe from drivers depending on their class (officers use phrases like, ``We can solve this the easy way'' to draw a bribe). The table below shows the resulting data.

ncol <- 3
df <- (nrow-1) * (ncol-1)
df
# Calculating pvalue
p_value <- pchisq(3.79, df=2, lower.tail = FALSE)p_value
# output 0.1503
	\end{lstlisting}
	
\begin{verbatim}
	If the p value is bigger than alpha then we can not reject the null hypothesis.
	 The null hypothesis is that there are no differences in the frequency of 
	 asking for a bribe between drivers of different socio-economic classes. 
	 The alternative hypothesis is that there are differences in the frequency 
	 bribes are requested depending on drivers socio-economic class. 
	 In this case alpha is 0.1 and p is 0.15 so p>alpha and we can't reject the H0.

\section*{Question 2: Economics}
Chattopadhyay and Duflo were interested in whether women promote different policies than men.\footnote{Chattopadhyay and Duflo. (2004). ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India. \textit{Econometrica}. 72 (5), 1409-1443.} Answering this question with observational data is pretty difficult due to potential confounding problems (e.g. the districts that choose female politicians are likely to systematically differ in other aspects too). Hence, they exploit a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, $\frac{1}{3}$ of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women. A subset of the data from West Bengal can be found at the following link: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv}\\

\noindent Each observation in the data set represents a village and there are two villages associated with one GP (i.e. a level of government is called "GP"). Figure~\ref{fig:women_desc} below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in the dataset. The authors hypothesize that female politicians are more likely to support policies female voters want. Researchers found that more women complain about the quality of drinking water than men. You need to estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.

with  p-value of 0.019, if we assume an alpha of 0.05, we have sufficient
evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However with a correlation coefficient
of 0.129 we can say that there is a weak correlation between the two variables,
since a strong correlation would be considered to have a correlation coefficient 
close to 1 for a positive correlation and close to -1 for a negative correlation.

	\vspace{6cm}
	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient estimate for reservation policy. 
	
\begin{verbatim}
	The coefficiet estimates tell us; first, that according to the intercept = 14.73,
	the average of water facilities (new or repaired) in the villages if there were 
	no reserved places for women leaders. The slope is 9.25 meaning that for 
	every increase of 1 reserved place the number of water facilities increases
	by 9.25.
